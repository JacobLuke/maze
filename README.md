maze
====

I was bored and felt like coding something up. 
Inspired by [TPP](https://sites.google.com/site/twitchplayspokemonstatus/), I realized something:
what if you took what made the Twitch experience great, all the chaos and unlikely cooperation, and integrated it into a game from the start?

And then I got off track and made an online maze puzzle in Node.js. Because __life is like that__.

Just check out the repo and enter

    node main.js
    
Obviously, you'll want to have `nodejs` installed, along with ExpressJS, socket.io, and probably a few packages I'm forgetting.
